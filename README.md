# Richie Frost  
## Software Engineer (and Data Scientist?) at Microsoft 
#### I have a job title at Microsoft, and it's Software Engineer. 

But my day-to-day is more like either a machine learning engineer or a data scientist. 

I'm not the kind of person (currently) that has a PhD with high quality publications. My work is 10% theoretical and 90% practical, being on an engineering team. But within that team, my role is to find insights within the data that can be exposed to the rest of our organization (Core Services Engineering and Operations), as well as Microsoft's partners. That's usually in the form of building machine learning and statistical models that are then consumed within Microsoft.

I feel like I should point out that I'm a recent university hire, and would love to help more people get a job at Microsoft, because it's been one of the best things that's happened to me and my family. I graduate from the University of Utah in December 2018 with a BS/MS in Computer Science and Computing. (The "Computing" degree is one I haven't seen around much, so I feel like I should explain what it is. Basically, I did a lot of data-focused classes for my Master's, mostly in NLP and text mining, and a capstone project to cap it all off that democratizes data science.)

## Research  
I did a little research in school at the University of Utah. Here's what came out of it:
- [AIPro](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~deb/aipro/) - An open source data processing framework for AI. Presented for demo at ICDE 2019 (My Master's degree capstone project) 
- [Compass](http://www.kdd.org/kdd2017/papers/view/compass-spatio-temporal-sentiment-analysis-of-us-election) - Spatiotemporal Sentiment Analysis of the US Presidential Election. Accepted at KDD 2017  
- [Estorm.org](http://estorm.org/) - Interactive data visualization for the Compass project  
- [Undergraduate Thesis](https://richiefrost.github.io/thesis.pdf) - Analysis of Scalable Topic Modeling in Latent Dirichlet Allocation
