# Richie Frost  
## Software Engineer at Microsoft 
I like Machine Learning, Data Science, and Software Engineering.  

Most recently, I graduated from the University of Utah with a BS in Computer Science and an MS in Computing, with an emphasis on Data Management and Analysis.

I work on the Finance Procure to Pay Data Platform team, working on anything from machine learning models for audit prediction to building a robust data platform.
