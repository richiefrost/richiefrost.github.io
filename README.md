As a software engineer at Microsoft, I work in Finance Engineering. I'm splitting my time between two different teams right now - the machine learning team and the data platform team, both within the Procure to Pay team.  

Most recently, I graduated from the University of Utah with a BS in Computer Science and an MS in Computing, with an emphasis on Data Management and Analysis.
