# How to work effectively in your spare time

What do you do when you want to take extra time to improve yourself and your craft, but have a pretty limited amount of time and/or energy?

I'm not 20 anymore. I don't have the energy I used to, for one, and I don't have the time - because I have other responsibilities that I didn't have when I was 20. I have two young kids that require a lot of attention and help, and my relationship with my wife is also incredibly important (the most important, for me). So what do you do when you have constraints like this?

The important thing, I think, is to make it count when you do have the time. Here are some tips I've found are useful for me:
1) Take care of your body first. Don't overdo it or you'll pay for it later. (Read: Get some sleep)
2) Do something you find enjoyable, or that makes your life easier in some way
3) Done, or at least working, is better than perfect.
4) Piggyback off of open source whenever possible
5) Contribute back to open source and get feedback
6) Build on your previous work - don't start from scratch every night
