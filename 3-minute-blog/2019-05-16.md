I feel way more excited about data science today. Thinking about the power of using conditional probabilities in my analyses and especially about using them to normalize continuous variables is intoxicating haha! I can’t stop thinking about comparing the mean and standard deviation over time too, to see if there’s any drift for a particular instance. It’s fun to think about how much power that can have on such an important problem too. It’s a really important problem, but it’s not like it’s a really hairy one either. The only thing that’s hard right now is just getting all of the data in one place, and getting the joins and stuff to work correctly. The data engineering is more the issue right now than the actual modeling. I wonder if I should just use a way smaller subset of the data to play around with first? Like if it would really be that different versus going big. I know there are bounds like PAC that could say how many examples I need, but I don’t know how to really gauge that. It’d probably be good to go back and look at how to do PAC and the Markov one too. Those are some really important metrics I think.
